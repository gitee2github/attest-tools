req-dummy.json: does not verify event logs; any measurement is valid

	This set of requirements is helpful for an initial testing of
	attest-tools. The RA Server will only verify that the TCG
	attestation structures are valid.


req-bios-ima.json: marks the BIOS event log as verified and checks IMA
		   boot_aggregate

	This set of requirements is helpful to test the IMA boot_aggregate
	verifier. It assumes that the IMA measurement list contains only
	the boot_aggregate entry (no policy is loaded).


req-bios-ima-sig.json: marks the BIOS event log as verified, checks IMA
                       boot_aggregate and verifies IMA signatures.

	This set of requirements does a complete verification of the IMA
	measurement list, assuming that only signed files are added to
	the list. This requirement must be edited to set acceptable keys
	for the ima_sig verifier. Requirements must be separated with
	the comma, and each requirement should have a valid prefix
	(e.g. 'subject:', 'subject-id:').
