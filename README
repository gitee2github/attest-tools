Installation instructions for libenroll

It is necessary to install the latest version of IBM TSS.

Also, the files ekutils.h and cryptoutils.h must be copied to
/usr/include/ibmtss.

It requires a patched version of libtpms (makecredential-devel-v1 branch in
https://github.com/euleros/libtpms), which exports the functions to make a
credential.

To use the enrollment client, it is necessary to manually download EK cert
issuer certificates (use scripts/ekcert_read.sh to get the EK cert from the TPM)
and to replace ek_ca_cert.pem in tests/test_client.c with the correct ones.

To use the enrollment server, it is necessary to generate a CA key pair and to
save the private key to cakey.pem.
